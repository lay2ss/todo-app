# Todo App - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is my solution for the **Todo App Challenge** from *Frontend Mentor*. The goal was to build a responsive and interactive Todo app with features like **dark/light mode**, **task filtering**, and **drag-and-drop reordering**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- ⚛ *React* – for building the UI components
